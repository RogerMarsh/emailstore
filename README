Description
===========

This package provides a select and store email interface given mailboxes populated by an email client.

Specify selection rules for emails by sender and date.

Extract emails from a set of mailboxes.

Allow specific emails to be excluded from the selection.


Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is not available on PyPI, or any other package index, but can be installed by typing

   python -m pip install --user --trusted-host solentware.co.uk --find-links http://solentware.co.uk/wheels.html emailstore

at the command prompt.

See `Python`_ and `pip`_ documentation for alternatives and platform-specific points.

Then run 'python -m pip check' to identify other packages which need to be installed.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m emailstore.emailstore

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m emailstore.emailstore

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python -m emailstore.emailstore

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 -m emailstore.emailstore

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting emailstore. 


Restrictions
============

The supported mailbox formats are:

* mbox
* `Opera`_'s directory structure for emails

At most one email per sender per second, looking at the date sent, is allowed.


Notes
=====

The current implementation does just enough to support the `ChessResults`_ package.

The configuration file editor interface is almost unusable.
