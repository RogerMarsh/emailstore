Description
===========

This package provides a select and store email interface given mailboxes populated by an email client.

Specify selection rules for emails by sender and date.

Extract emails from a set of mailboxes.

Allow specific emails to be excluded from the selection.


Installation Instructions
=========================

Usually this package will be installed by installing `ChessResults`_.

Install the package by typing

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.

Use `Python`_ 3.3 or later.


Run
===

The command to run this package is:

   python -m emailstore.emailstore

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> -m emailstore.emailstore

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python -m emailstore.emailstore

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 -m emailstore.emailstore

         on Unix-like systems.

Or use the facilities of your desktop (Microsoft Windows, GNOME, KDE, ...) to set up a convenient way of starting chessgames. 


Restrictions
============

The supported mailbox formats are:

* mbox
* `Opera`_'s directory structure for emails

At most one email per sender per second, looking at the date sent, is allowed.


Notes
=====

The current implementation does just enough to support the `ChessResults`_ package.

The configuration file editor interface is almost unusable.
