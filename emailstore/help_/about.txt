EmailStore picks emails from an email client's mailboxes using rules given in a configuration file and stores them as files in a directory.


Run 'python -m pip show emailstore' at a command line to display version and dependency (requires and required-by) information.

Version numbers for the packages listed under 'requires' are given in the setup.cfg file.

Run 'python -m pip check' at a command line to display discrepancies between required and installed versions of packages.

'python' may need to be replaced by <path to>python<version> depending on the system configuration: 'python3.8' for example.

EmailStore uses features introduced at Python3.3.

Python3.3, or later versions when available, must be installed to run EmailStore.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run EmailStore.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
