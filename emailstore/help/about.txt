EmailStore picks emails from an email client's mailboxes using rules given in a configuration file and stores them as files in a directory.


This is emailstore-1.4.1

It depends on the following being installed:
solentware-grid-2.1
solentware-misc-1.3

EmailStore uses features introduced at Python3.3.

Python3.3, or later versions when available, must be installed to run EmailStore.

tkinter, part of Python, must be installed to run EmailStore.  Sometimes this is installed separately.
